# AndroidCalculator

This is the first homework project for EnhanceIT. This was completed on Week 1 Day 4.

This is a very simple app that simply changes the text value of a TextView object. 
The text cycles through the values of the human lifecycle from newborn to senior then over again.

This was accomplished with an array of strings, an index counter, and an OnClickListener function. 

Future updates to be made.
  - Fancy text
  - color change upon age
  - toasts to mark important steps
  - Spinny text(?)
